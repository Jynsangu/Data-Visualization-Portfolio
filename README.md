Data Visualization using Power BI
## Introduction

> My portfolio contains 3 current projects that showcase my skills in data visualization using Power BI. For Data confidentiality, changes have been made to the Sub County, Region, Facility and the data itself. 
> Basically, the users of all the dashboards are the Senior Technical Teams, Program officers, Strategic Information officers and Program Director.
> Data received via aggregate database systems are pulled , cleaned and analyzed using MS Excel and R Studio.
> The tool used to create these dashboards is Power BI with the use of Data Analysis Expresseions (DAX) such as DIVIDE(),CALCULATE(),SUMX(),FILTER(),FORMAT() among others to carry out calculations and enhance the data model.

## COVID Dashboard

* COVID 19 Dashboard represents data from the start of our Program year 1 (Oct 2021 to Sep 2022) and Program year 2 (Oct 2022 to date). 
* At the start of the COVID vaccination, the team wanted a visual way to assess the uptake of vaccination among the HIV Positive on medication patients in our program health centres/facilities and thus, advise decision makers on measures or practices to put in place to encourage / speed up the vaccine uptake. 
* My design choice is a simple, interactive and orderly (non-cluttered) dashboard. Visual appeal is key in terms of a colourful dashboard with a splash of the organization colours in some areas of the dashboard. 
* Trend lines show the progress per month with DAX Expressions that filter the data being displayed on the cards for the latest month.

## Male Circumcision Dashboard

* Male Circumcision (VMMC) Dashboard represents data from the start of our Program year 1  (Oct 2021 to Sep 2022) and Program year 2 (Oct 2022 to date). 
* Male circumcision is not a cultural practice in Siaya which has a high prevalance of HIV. Male circumcision is a way to aid in the prevention of the spread of HIV.
* The dashboard seeks to visually show the two types of cicumcision procedures (Ring device and surgery) being offered, the uptake of the services, patient preferences and the uptake per age group. The dashboard aids decision making on the service(s) to focus on, distribution of resources (Ring devices, surgeons,etc), fund allocation and the age group that needs further education and community outreach opportunities to encourage circumcision.
* Yearly targets are set and the dashboard gives a picture of where the team actually is against the target of the Program year.
* Black was a colour choice based on my desire for a unique appearance and since it is a male indicator. The vibrant colours are for data and visuals to be clear against the dark background with tables to enable data to be visualized as a cascade and the trend chart to show progress through each month (Drastic drops can lead to intervention or inquiry on reasons for a drop in numbers / percentage).

## Cervical Cancer Dashboard
* Cervical Cancer Dashboard represents data from the start of our Program year (Oct 2021 to Sep 2022) and Program year 2 (Oct 2022 to date).
* Cervical Cancer is a disease that is highly prevalent among the HIV Positive patients as compared to the HIV Negative patients. 
* With an assigned yearly cervical cancer screening target, the dashboard gives a picture of where the team is in terms of numbers and/or percentages.
* The dashboard shows those screened for cancer, all the three possible outcomes (Negative, Positive or Suspected cancer) and the patients with Positives & Suspected outcomes that were offered some form of treatment.
* Based on the design, teams can assess which health centres / facilities require support in terms of human resource, supplies, education and funding. 
* The choice of purple colour was basically due to the indicator being all female, to add brightness and clarity to the visual. The gauge is a simple and effective way to show the actual numbers against the target assigned.
